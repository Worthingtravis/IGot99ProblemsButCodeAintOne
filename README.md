# Personal Website

### This is my personal website, built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS and TypeScript.


### Requirements
- Node.js 16+ and npm

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```
npm install
```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/resume with your favorite browser to see your project.

```shell

```
One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is that it allows us to automatically generate a `CHANGELOG` file. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.

### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```shell
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```
